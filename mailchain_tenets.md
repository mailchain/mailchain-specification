## Mailchain Tenets
Mailchain’s tenets guide its approach to design and decision-making. 

Unless you know better ones…

1. User experience: Users expect a good experience. There should be no compromise on delivering the best experience within the bounds of today’s available technology.

2. Enable Anonymity: Many blockchains offer a degree of (pseudo-)anonymity to public addresses or accounts. Mailchain enables the preservation of anonymity to the degree permitted by the underlying protocol.

3. Enable Decentralisation: Many blockchain protocols are designed to run applications and store data in a decentralised way. Wherever possible, Mailchain removes centralized dependencies respecting that users may wish to run the software in a decentralized configuration.

4. Standards-based: Mailchain seeks to follow and contribute to existing standards. If no standard exists, we will propose new, open, high quality standards that others can adopt.

5. Low Cost: Interacting with blockchains can have an associated cost (e.g. Gas, transactions fees, storage fees etc.). Mailchain seeks to optimize the costs of sending messages.
